d.	Payment date should be automatically taken 
e.	Subscription end date should not be less then subscription start date 
f.	Allowed values for subscription status are â€“ Active, Expired, Cancelled

Stage 2 : Data Access Layer Design

1.	Created a library project and add ORM support into it.

2.	This class library will contain various service classes which will encapsulate the business logic for the application. 
3.	Use dependency injection to in service classes to inject the required repositories. 
4.	Created the service classes following the single responsibility principle which perform the given operations as follows

d.	Whenever a subscription is successfully created an auto-generated subscriptionid must be displayed backed 
 
Stage 4 : Unit Testing 

1.	Created a new Unit test project to test the service classes created in business logic layers 
2.	Mock all the repositories using a mocking framework. 
 
Stage 5 : Micro-service implementation 

1.	Created an API project which references the business logic layer created earlier 
2.	Implement service documentation using swagger 
3.	Created the following end-points and test them using postman and export the requests into a json file.

Stage 6 : Front end design 
 
1.	Created the following components as per the specification provided below.  
a.	SearchTransportationComponent 
1.	Create a component which allows users to view the currently available transportation services in a tabular format 
2.	User should provide a pickup location and click the search button to view the available transport services 
3.	If a service is available it should have a button to subscribe 
4.	Provide a navigation link in the navbar of the application to access the component 
 
b.	SubscribeTransportationComponent

2.	Use the data service in the components to make them interact with the API 
3.	Valid error messages should be shown based on various response status codes received form the API .
